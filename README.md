  <h2>Problem Statement :</h2>
  <h3>Topic Modeling for Research Articles</h3>
  <p>Researchers have access to large online archives of scientific articles. As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling     provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process. <br>
Given the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set. 
Note that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic. The research article abstracts and titles are sourced from the following 6 topics: 
<ul>
  <li>Computer Science</li>
  <li>Physics</li>
  <li>Mathematics</li>
  <li>Statistics</li>
  <li>Quantitative Biology</li>
  <li>Quantitative Finance</li>
</ul>
