      "TITLE -\tReconstructing Subject-Specific Effect Maps\n",
      "ABSTRACT -\tPredictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease related alterations in neuroimaging data .  Given a subject's data ,  inference can be made at two levels: global ,  i . e .  identifiying condition presence for the subject ,  and local ,  i . e .  detecting condition effect on each individual measurement extracted from the subject's data .  While global inference is widely used ,  local inference ,  which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps ,  is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of dispersed isolated islands .  In this article ,  we propose a reconstruction method ,  named RSM ,  to improve subject-specific detections of predictive modeling approaches and in particular ,  binary classifiers .  RSM specifically aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite sample of examples to train classifiers .  The proposed method is a wrapper-type algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic manner ,  i . e .  without information on condition presence .  Reconstruction is posed as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion .  Experimental evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative  ( ADNI )  database .  Results on synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging .  Analyses on the ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers of Alzheimer's Disease  ( AD )  ,  such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels .  Further reliability studies on the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when RSM is used . \n",

      "ABSTRACT -\tRotation invariance and translation invariance have great values in image recognition tasks .  In this paper ,  we bring a new architecture in convolutional neural network  ( CNN )  named cyclic convolutional layer to achieve rotation invariance in 2-D symbol recognition .  We can also get the position and orientation of the 2-D symbol by the network to achieve detection purpose for multiple non-overlap target .  Last but not least ,  this architecture can achieve one-shot learning in some cases using those invariance . \n",

      "ABSTRACT -\tWe introduce and develop the notion of spherical polyharmonics ,  which are a natural generalisation of spherical harmonics .  In particular we study the theory of zonal polyharmonics ,  which allows us ,  analogously to zonal harmonics ,  to construct Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls .  We find the representation of Poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials .  We show the connection between the classical Poisson kernel for harmonic functions on the ball ,  Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls ,  and the Cauchy-Hua kernel for holomorphic functions on the Lie ball . \n",

      "ABSTRACT -\tThe stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert  ( LLG )  equation coupled with the Maxwell equations  ( the so called stochastic MLLG system )  describes the creation of domain walls and vortices  ( fundamental objects for the novel nanostructured magnetic memories )  .  We first reformulate the stochastic LLG equation into an equation with time-differentiable solutions .  We then propose a convergent $\\theta$-linear scheme to approximate the solutions of the reformulated system .  As a consequence ,  we prove convergence of the approximate solutions ,  with no or minor conditions on time and space steps  ( depending on the value of $\\theta$ )  .  Hence ,  we prove the existence of weak martingale solutions of the stochastic MLLG system .  Numerical results are presented to show applicability of the method . \n",

      "TITLE -\tComparative study of Discrete Wavelet Transforms and Wavelet Tensor Train decomposition to feature extraction of FTIR data of medicinal plants\n",
      "ABSTRACT -\tFourier-transform infra-red  ( FTIR )  spectra of samples from 7 plant species were used to explore the influence of preprocessing and feature extraction on efficiency of machine learning algorithms .  Wavelet Tensor Train  ( WTT )  and Discrete Wavelet Transforms  ( DWT )  were compared as feature extraction techniques for FTIR data of medicinal plants .  Various combinations of signal processing steps showed different behavior when applied to classification and clustering tasks .  Best results for WTT and DWT found through grid search were similar ,  significantly improving quality of clustering as well as classification accuracy for tuned logistic regression in comparison to original spectra .  Unlike DWT ,  WTT has only one parameter to be tuned  ( rank )  ,  making it a more versatile and easier to use as a data processing tool in various signal processing applications . \n",
